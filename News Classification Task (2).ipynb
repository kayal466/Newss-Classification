       " 'The average cost of daycare per week is $293 for one toddler and $556 for two, according to Care.com. But the actual cost of care to a family varies widely based on zip code, a child’s age, and whether a parent is seeking home-based care or center care.',\n",
       " 'All in, however, data from the US Department of Labor show the annual cost for care of just one child — whether infant, toddler, pre-school or school-age — can easily eat up 15% to 20% of the median family income in many counties across the country.',\n",
       " 'That is well above the 7% of family income that the US Department of Health and Human Services set as a federal benchmark for affordability.',\n",
       " 'As for availability, while the number of child care programs has gone up since the pandemic, there are now fewer employees per program, according to HHS.',\n",
       " 'Making matters more precarious is the expiration of pandemic-era federal child care stabilization funds. That may lead to higher prices, exacerbate staffing shortages and lead to licensed child care program closures, according to the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank.',\n",
       " '“Paying is the largest issue. But there also are not enough child care providers, period,” said Jessica Chang, CEO and co-founder of Upwards, which partners with employers and federal and state governments to make child care more accessible to all families, especially low-income earners.',\n",
       " 'It also helps to create more licensed child care providers through training and practical support for obtaining a license and handling the administrative work of running a business.',\n",
       " 'The pandemic laid bare to employers their workers’ child care struggles. And the subsequent tug of war over returning to the office has further underscored it.',\n",
       " '“Covid was a blessing in disguise,” Chang said.“Employers realize that no longer is child care just a social issue but a business issue. When you have trouble attracting and retaining employees, it affects your bottom line.”',\n",
       " 'A survey last year by human resources consulting firm Mercer found that 54% of employers with at least 500 employees do not offer any child care benefits. And among those that do, less than a third selected any single benefit such as subsidized child care services (11%), child care referrals and consultations (28%); and back up child care (26%), which gives parents access to a daycare center or babysitter when their usual child care arrangements fall through on a given day.',\n",
       " 'It’s not much different for employers with 5,000 or more employees. Among those, 37% offer access to backup child care, 16% subsidize child care and 10% provide onsite child care.',\n",
       " 'So perhaps it’s not surprising that three-quarters of working mothers surveyed by Moms First and the Adecco Group US Foundation last year said their company could be doing more to support parents with young children.',\n",
       " 'Among respondents who said they were thinking of quitting their jobs, 41% said their compensation was not high enough to cover child care costs, and 30% said they didn’t have adequate child care.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, Upwards and Bright Horizons, a leading provider of early education and child care centers as well as backup care, are hearing from a growing number of employers that are seeking to offer child care benefits for the first time or expand the ones they have in place.',\n",
       " '“There was a very large uptick in clients’ interest in offering backup care (during the pandemic). We’ve seen that interest continue post-pandemic,” said Bright Horizons CEO Stephen Kramer.',\n",
       " 'Kramer said he is also hearing growing interest from employers about providing on-site child care to help make it easier for working parents to return to their physical workplace.',\n",
       " '“The most critical issues employees are raising with employers is about RTO or working at all,” he said.',\n",
       " 'An onsite child care center like one from Bright Horizons can provide licensed and trained care providers and well-qualified early education teachers. And it prioritizes admission for a company’s employees, which might be attractive for parents who are still on a waitlist at a child care provider near their home and who can afford the cost of an onsite center.',\n",
       " 'For many employers, though, an onsite child care center may be tough to swing. But they’re just as interested in attracting and retaining workers, and can find other ways to make the quest for good child care easier.',\n",
       " 'Like many companies, One Workplace, a California-based office design and solutions provider with roughly 950 employees, hadn’t offered child care benefits before Covid-19 hit.',\n",
       " 'As the company started experimenting with return-to-office in the latter part of the pandemic, it surveyed its working parents to learn about what they wanted, said Carmen Perez-Seda, the company’s talent director.',\n",
       " 'In response to that survey, it partnered with Upwards in January 2023 to offer all employees free access to Upwards’ care provider network and a free, dedicated care manager who worked with parents individually to find them attractive care options based on their needs and location.',\n",
       " 'The company also offered employees three free days of backup care a year through the Upwards network. But that backup benefit was replaced this year by cash stipend of $200 a quarter to help them pay for any kind of child care or after-school programs of their choosing.',\n",
       " 'To date, Perez-Seda said, 93% of employees who have used Upwards’ services found licensed and accredited child care within their home zip codes.',\n",
       " 'The help for working parents whose employers don’t offer a direct financial assist with child care may come through state and local subsidies if their income is low enough, Chang said.',\n",
       " 'And for all parents, they can get some help through the federal tax code, whether by contributing to a tax-advantaged dependent care account, claiming the child tax credit or, if their income is low enough, claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit.',\n",
       " 'The downside for any parent living paycheck to paycheck, however, is that they usually only get that financial assist through a refund, which typically comes months after they have had to pay their child care bills.']"

       " 'Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035, according to Moody’s industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are manageable, he said, but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now, the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized, Heck pointed out.',\n",
       " 'Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help, too.',\n",
       " 'It’s important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be different from what’s on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it’s not like EVs will flood America’s roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different.',\n",
       " '‘We’re talking about past cost parity, so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper,” compared to a gas-powered car, he said.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody’s Heck predicted that next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster.',\n",
       " 'So when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price, Harto said.',\n",
       " 'There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are “EV equivalents” available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at 8.5%.',\n",
       " 'Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be “EV equivalents” for 75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032.',\n",
       " 'California plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035, a goal it’s on the way to meeting, according to Corey Cantor, an analyst with Bloomberg NEF. So California should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, by 2032 and California itself, through its sheer size, is a big factor in the overall US vehicle market.',\n",
       " '“California’s influence on the whole country Is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without California,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Reaching two-thirds EV market share mark by 2032 isn’t a sure thing, said Cantor, but it should be manageable.',\n",
       " 'The increasing number of automakers entering the EV market will also help, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand.',\n",
       " '“Not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it’s an EV or it has X-Y-Z piece of technology,” said Drury. ” I think that when you have something like Toyota, definitely a loyal consumer base, they don’t want anything other than Toyotas.”',\n",
       " 'Currently, Toyota offers only one electric model in the United States, the BZ4X SUV, but more are planned. Honda, another Japanese brand with a loyal following, offers no EVs currently but the company is gearing up factories in Ohio to build future EV models. Honda expects to offer its first EV next year. General Motors also has a number of EV models coming in the next year or two.',\n",
       " 'GM, on its own, will provide a good test of the American market’s readiness for EVs in the next couple of years, said Drury. That automaker, which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by 2035, will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points.',\n",
       " 'The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country, posted a statement on its website expressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies.',\n",
       " '“[A] lot has to go right for this massive – and unprecedented – change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” the group wrote in its statement.',\n",
       " 'At some point, various automakers that may have been slower than GM to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons, said Cantor. Once consumers start broadly embracing EVs, continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won’t make economic sense any longer.']"

It requires a criminal essentially watching an iPhone user enter the device’s passcode – for example, by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event – or manipulating the device’s owner so they’ll share their passcode. And that’s all before they physically steal the device.',\n",

       " 'Another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by Apple but one that’s been circulating online. Within an iPhone’s Screen Time setting, which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device, there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they could successfully change an Apple ID.',\n",
       " 'By enabling this, a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an Apple ID password.',\n",
       " 'Finally, users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iPhone – via iCloud or iTunes – so data can be recovered in the case an iPhone is stolen. At the same time, users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Photos or Dropbox.',\n",

       " \"Let's start with a 12 year old I know - my son.\",\n",
       " \"He loves Minecraft, and plays it wherever he can. On his phone, on his tablet, on our PlayStation, on his dad's Xbox. He watches Minecraft videos on YouTube and he uses an unofficial app to create and share skins and mods.\",\n",
       " \"He doesn't care who owns the game (Microsoft bought the Mojang studio in 2014) and he has no brand loyalty to a particular device - his favourite is whichever one is to hand.\",\n",
       " \"This is what the games giants are up against: a generation of young gamers who don't buy into their hype.\",\n",

       " 'But then he added: \"I have a fundamental belief that in the next five to 10 years, exclusive games, which are exclusive to one piece of hardware, are going to be a smaller and smaller part of the games industry.\"',\n",
       " \"And it's not just Xbox warming to the idea - there have been similar rumblings from Sony. In a recent earnings call, interim gaming president Hiroki Totoki said that he wanted to put more PlayStation games onto other platforms.\",\n",
       " 'Much like Microsoft, he did not name any particular games, or specific platforms. It is possible he meant the firm would continue with the status quo of putting PlayStation games onto PC several months or even years after their release.',\n",
       " 'Following years of fierce rivalry between the two firms, and expensive acquisitions of successful games studios producing the most popular games, in an attempt to lock in the best content to their own customers, this is definitely a change of heart (Nintendo meanwhile, still has more of a tendency to keep its games to itself).',\n",
       " \"The idea of basically turning any device with a screen into your company's console is blisteringly simple, when you think about it. Why go through the expensive and time-consuming process of building and selling proprietary hardware when so many people are essentially carrying around a high-performance computer already, in the form of their phones?\",\n",
       " \"Why restrict access to your best-selling titles when there's a vast audience with alternative devices out there who also want to buy them, play them, and pay for in-game extras?\",\n",
       " \"The analysts Ampere estimated that in 2023 there were a total of around 46.5m consoles sold, of which only 7.6m were Microsoft's Xbox. That leaves nearly 39 million gamers that Xbox exclusives such as the long awaited Starfield from Bethesda, didn't reach.\",\n",
       " 'You begin to see that this is an old-fashioned business model, with an old-fashioned motive: money.',\n",
       " '\"The key reason Microsoft has been pursuing a more progressive multi-platform strategy with its games content and services since early in the Xbox One cycle is because it was unable to build on the relative success of the Xbox 360 era and take market share from Sony, and latterly, Nintendo post-the launch of the Switch,\" says analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere.',\n",
       " 'In addition Microsoft has been busy hoovering up successful games studios for large amounts of cash - at a time when making games is already an expensive business.',\n",
       " \"Indeed, during its contentious $68bn acquisition of the massive games maker Activision Blizzard, one of Sony's chief objections was that it could make smash hits like Call of Duty, played by millions on PlayStations, Xbox-exclusives. Microsoft was forced to promise that it would not do so for at least 10 years.\",\n",
       " \"There has even been speculation that Microsoft might be preparing to walk away from the hardware market altogether, abandoning the Xbox console entirely, but Mr Harding-Rolls doesn't think something that dramatic is on the horizon.\",\n",
       " '\"Ampere does not expect Microsoft to exit the console platform business in the medium term as that would leave a gaping hole in its games-related revenues,\" he added.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, Xbox president Sarah Bond even teased the idea of some brand new hardware in a podcast released by Microsoft on Thursday.',\n",
       " '\"What we\\'re really focused on there is delivering the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation,\" she said.',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately, your guess about that at this stage is as good as ours, although the rumour mill is going into overdrive that it could be some kind of handheld device, designed to compete with the huge success of the Nintendo Switch.',\n",
       " 'In any case Darren Edwards from gaming news website TheXboxHub sums it up neatly: \"It\\'s hardly a doomsday scenario for Xbox.\"',\n",
       " \"As for the games themselves, Microsoft's preferred gateway is via Games Pass. For £12.99 per month, it offers unlimited streaming access to hundreds of titles.\",\n",

Last November, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) was also hit with major repercussions in the financial world. Others reported to have been hit include suppliers to the NHS, law firm Allen & Overy and Boeing, the aerospace company.',\n",

Still visually dazzling and overwhelming in its scale, “Dune: Part Two” becomes enmeshed in the political denseness of author Frank Herbert’s world, unevenly marching through this part of the story before rather abruptly coming to an end.',\n",
       " 'Much has changed since the first movie was simultaneously released in theaters and via streaming during the height of the pandemic (a decision the director sharply criticized), and the reloaded cast remains plenty starry, including a meatier role for Zendaya in this chapter.',\n",

At the same time, the pacing proves more halting, particularly in the first hour or so of this 166-minute spectacle, which plunges deeply into the intricacies of imperial politics and Fremen customs, punctuated by skirmishes in the larger war.',\n",
       " 'That languid opening stretch comes back to haunt the movie toward the end, when it feels as if Villeneuve (who shares screenplay credit with Jon Spaihts) is rushing toward a climax that again sends the message – or the hope – that this might not be the last we’ll see of “Dune.” There’s also a questionable decision in having Paul’s witchy mom, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), communicating with her unborn daughter who “speaks” to her from the womb.',\n",
       " 'A true Warner Bros. MVP between this and “Wonka,” Chalamet credibly shoulders the weight of a character maturing from callow youth into commanding savior, but those playing the villains frankly appear to be having a lot more fun, except possibly Javier Bardem as Stilgar, whose faith makes him Paul’s biggest Fremen fan.',\n",
       " 'From a more earthbound perspective, after a delay due to Hollywood’s twin strikes, the “Dune” sequel has emerged as the latest ray of hope in Hollywood’s often-frustrating crusade to entice people back into theater seats, nearing the end of a discontented winter that has produced few bright spots.',\n",
       " 'Like “Dune’s” first half and the “Avatar” movies, “Part Two” possesses state-of-the-art cinematic qualities that reward soaking in its grandeur, at least for anyone who hasn’t entirely lost the moviegoing habit. After the initial promise, though, the film only sporadically rises to the level of its sky-high expectations – a somewhat ironic sign of how quickly the worm can turn.',\n",

       "['“Willow,” the 1988 fantasy film costarring Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer, tells the tale of an aspiring wizard in a magical world who, despite his small stature and a treacherous journey, is destined for greatness. The plot might be an allegory for the movie itself, as well as its legacy, since some 35 years later, the relatively esoteric title is getting a brand new life by way of a big-budget fantasy series premiering this week on Disney+.',\n",
       " 'It’s a refreshing turn against recent trends that a cult classic without the sizable built-in fanbase of, say, a “Star Wars” or Marvel property would receive the fancy reboot treatment. But those who have loved the film, directed by Ron Howard, are eager for its arrival – even if they might not necessarily have strength in numbers.',\n",
       " 'Alban Leloup, the administrator for the Willow Wiki page at Fandom, told CNN that “Willow” fans are somewhat “hard to pinpoint,” describing them as “small pockets” scattered among sites like Tumblr and Facebook.',\n",
       " '“There hasn’t been, so far, a centralized community,” he said.',\n",
       " 'According to Fandom community partnership specialist (and “Willow” fan) Mike Delaney, there is also a fair amount of crossover with “Star Wars” – most likely because George Lucas provided the idea for the original film.',\n",
       " '“Willow” loyalists, he said, “look upon ‘Willow’ as a very fun part of the LucasFilm family of films.”',\n",
       " 'Delaney likened “Willow” to the Jim Henson gem “Labyrinth” and other landmark movies of the period, saying it “was one of those films in the ’80s that introduced a lot of people to the idea of fantasy films in general and brought them into the mainstream.”',\n",
       " '“There’s this great generational aspect to it,” he added. “In the same way that ‘Star Wars’ does, and other films from the ’80s era that have this nostalgic factor to it, people enjoy carrying it with them and passing it down to their own family and their own friends.”',\n",
       " 'Nonetheless, “Willow” remains a rather obscure reference next to “Star Wars” and countless other titles, with Delaney acknowledging that as a single film, there’s “not a lot to draw from,” pointing to the scant other “Willow” content that has arisen in the interim – a comic book, a role-playing game sourcebook and a trilogy of novels written by Chris Claremont (and outlined by Lucas).',\n",
       " 'A good indicator of how niche “Willow” is, both Leloup and Delaney agree, is observing just how rare it is to see the film celebrated at film or fantasy conventions.',\n",
       " '“You could be walking around a convention floor, and in a sea of Harley Quinns, you’ll spot a Willow,” Delaney observed. “You have that little moment where you’re like, ‘I know who you are. I know that you’re playing as Willow!’ And there’s probably a load of people around who have no idea who they’re dressed as.”',\n",
       " 'Since the series was announced, “there has been a spike” in interest, Leloup said, which they’ve seen reflected in their web traffic and interactions on their site.',\n",
       " '“There’s always a delicate balance between keeping the old fans in the fold, with familiar respects, familiar themes, familiar feel, but at the same time you’re wishing to attract a whole new group,” Leloup said of the growth.',\n",
       " 'The arrival of the new 8-episode series comes with high hopes from the small but mighty fanbase.',\n",
       " 'The pilot of the show was executive produced by Howard, along with LucasFilm president and super producer Kathleen Kennedy. Bob Dolman, who wrote the screenplay for the original film, also acted as supervising producer on the first episode.',\n",
       " 'In terms of what he’s most excited about in the new series, Leloup points to the lore presented in the original movie and where it might go next.',\n",
       " '“There are many sorts of nerds, and I call myself a lore nerd. What I like first and foremost, almost on an equal footing with storytelling, is world-building,” he said. “I am just curious to see where they are going to take this world, and how much world-building they’ll be adding to it.”',\n",
       " 'Within that lore is central character Elora Danan in the original movie – a baby princess destined to defeat the evil queen Bavmorda and protected by Willow – and how she’ll figure in the new series.',\n",
       " 'The Elora character, who is only mentioned but not seen in the promotional materials for the show, is in fact credited as the reasoning behind why such a small property from the LucasFilm oeuvre was brought back in the first place.',\n",
       " '“Willow” showrunner and creator Jonathan Kasdan told GamesRadar.com this month, “there are a million unanswered questions from the movie, but for me there’s only one, and it’s the reason we did this show at all: what happened to that baby? I think, more than anything George Lucas has done, ‘Willow’ was the one that said ‘sequel’ to me.”',\n",
       " 'He later added, “‘Willow’ ended with the most powerful person in the world as an eight-month-old infant, so it felt like there was story left to tell.”',\n",
       " 'As for that new story, not much has been revealed, other than the fact that it’s set decades after the events of the original film, with Willow being called upon for yet another perilous quest, this time to rescue the twin brother of Kit (Ruby Cruz), after he was abducted by mysterious evil forces.',\n",
       " 'Fandom director of community activations and “Willow” superfan Brian Linder also mentioned another recognizable name in the new cast. “It’ll be interesting to see what Christian Slater’s character is all about.” Slater is credited as part of the cast of the series, but no information on his character is available yet.',\n",
       " 'Original star Kilmer, who played the dashing swordsman Madmartigan in the original film, had to be written out of the series just ahead of filming due to Covid-19 restrictions, but Delaney point to fan theories that Slater will perhaps step in for the character in some way. Kilmer’s ex-wife Joanne Whalley, who he met on the original film, will be back in the series as warrior Sorsha.',\n",
       " 'Delaney is also looking forward to how the team behind the new series will incorporate more inclusive casting in the world of “Willow,” which in 1988 featured a predominantly White cast.',\n",
       " 'New additions to the series include “Raised By Wolves” and “Solo” star Erin Kellyman, Tony Revolori of “Spider-Man: Homecoming” fame, and Amar Chadha-Patel.',\n",
       " 'Delaney said nothing can be lost from bringing “fresh ideas into a 35-year-old franchise.”',\n",
       " '“I think there’s a bit of excitement to see exactly what they can bring to that and to make ‘Willow’ more relevant for the current generation and the current entertainment landscape,” he said.',\n",

The 1965 film was created as a TV special with financial backing from Coca-Cola, but was put together in just a matter of weeks to meet broadcast demands.',\n",

Most well-known is the fact that Vera-Ellen, who played Judy Haynes, didn’t do any of her own singing. (Her dancing, though, was a different story.) Singer Trudy Stevens provided Judy’s voice.',\n",
       " 'All of the songs in “White Christmas” were written by Irving Berlin, the legendary songwriter who wrote hundreds of hits, including “God Bless America.” “White Christmas” is one of his most famous tunes, and it was originally performed in the 1942 film “Holiday Inn.”',\n",
       " 'The song “Snow,” sung by the starring “White Christmas” foursome as they head to Vermont, was originally called “Free,” and was written for a musical called “Call Me Madam.” It had a completely different set of lyrics, which Berlin changed to fit the film’s holiday feel.',\n",
       " 'Do you know “Seussian Latin?” The term describes the robust collection of made-up words used by author Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss. For the 1966 animated classic “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” producers wanted the musical feeling of a Christmas special, but didn’t want to include elements that would seem out of sync with Seuss’ fantastical world.',\n",

       " 'Stop-motion animation is an art form forged with exquisite craftsmanship and a lot of patience. The animators behind 1993’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas” used about 400 different hand-sculpted heads to bring Jack Skellington to life. In a behind-the-scenes special about the film, animators explain that every sound and facial expression Jack made required a different head that could be popped on and off of the character’s puppet body. With that kind of painstaking work, it’s no wonder the film took three years to make!',\n",
       " 'Rudolph may have been a cute little boy reindeer in the 1964 TV special, but he was brought to life by Canadian voice actor Billie Mae Richards. Most of the voice cast for this stop-motion classic was actually Canadian because it was cheaper to record audio for the special in Canada. However, in the original credits of the film, Richards is noted as Billy Richards.',\n",

       " 'By all accounts, Michael Caine had a great time acting as one of the sole humans in 1992’s “The Muppet Christmas Carol.” However, being a giant among puppets comes with a few challenges. The bottom of the sets were made up of a series of pits to allow room for Muppet puppeteers. That meant Caine and his fellow humans had to walk on boards above the puppeteers, kind of like an advanced version of “the floor is lava.” (The floor is people, perhaps.)',\n",
       " 'Set designers also used forced perspective to keep everything in proportion – a common set trick that’s also used at numerous theme parks. They also included a nice nod to Caine: One of the signs on the street set reads “Micklewhite’s,” which is Caine’s real last name.',\n",
       " 'Not all movie magic is high-tech. In the 1940s, when “It’s a Wonderful Life” was produced, movie crews typically used painted cornflakes as snow. Though melt-proof, they were also a little too … crunchy. The film’s director Frank Capra decided to try something quieter, and landed on a custom blend for his winter scenes: Ivory soap flakes, chipped ice, and Foamite, a compound used in fire extinguishers. According to the “It’s a Wonderful Life” museum, if you pay close attention to the scene with Clarence and George in the river, you can see some tell-tale soap suds floating by.',\n",
       " 'Perk up your ears while watching the 1983 comedy “Trading Places.” The classical music heard in the opening scene, and throughout the movie, is from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s opera “The Marriage of Figaro.” Christmas movies and classical music go together like milk and cookies, (“Ode to Joy” and “Die Hard,” anyone?) but Elmer Bernstein, who scored the film, was especially clever to add this particular piece.',\n",

       " 'The original story was called “The Greatest Gift,” by Philip Van Doren Stern, and according to the text republished in Basinger’s book, it is there that George first utters the immortal line, “I said I wish I’d never been born.”',\n",

       " '“I know he is a meanie but he adds depth to the movie,” she said.',\n",

At 27, Ed Dwight was offered an opportunity to become the first Black astronaut in 1961, but faced the headwinds of being portrayed as a token addition by legendary pilot Chuck Yeager, who, as Dwight tells it, instructed his peers not to interact with him and kept pressuring him to quit.',\n",

In the process, the filmmakers add welcome context to the central topic and give time to related matters like the symbolic importance of “Star Trek” – with its hopeful vision of the future – and the influence of actress Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a.

       " 'The studio has held the film rights for Spider-Man since 1999. Although it agreed to share the rights with Disney’s Marvel Studios in 2015, allowing Spidey to catapult into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sony still holds the rights to a wide portfolio of less popular Spider-Man-adjacent characters like Venom, Morbius, Spider-Woman and Madame Web.',\n",
       " '“Lesser known characters from the comic book realm can still succeed when the ingredients come together, not unlike the way original films can stand out in a moviegoing world often dominated by franchises,” said BoxOffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins. “The roots of Madame Web’s struggles are multifaceted, but they boil down to two factors: audiences are increasingly selective with the superhero content they choose to spend money on in 2024 and this particular film was met with frequently negative feedback throughout marketing.”',\n",
       " 'After years of Marvel-mania, culminating in the record-breaking success of the Avengers franchise with “Infinity War” and “Endgame,” theatergoers have started to bemoan the oversaturation of superhero projects across studios. In November, “The Marvels” saw a lackluster $47 million in domestic sales its opening weekend, and DC’s “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” opened in December to a feeble $27.6 million. “Aquaman” was distributed by Warner Bros., which shares the same parent company as CNN.',\n",
       " 'Some industry analysts say that the problem is not superhero movies as a genre, but the quality of the movie itself.',\n",
       " '“Offering up a great film is really the key since the core audience for these films are not mere spectators but passionate enthusiasts who need more than some cookie-cutter marketing message to get them in the door,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “That said, ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ looks to show that there are exceptions to every rule with an expected massive debut later this summer.”',\n",
       " 'While Sony’s “The Amazing Spider-Man” 1&2, “Venom” and its sequel saw opening weekends ranging between $62 million and $90 million, 2022’s “Morbius” opened with a disastrous $39 million. All Spider-Man and Venom movies grossed more than $200 million during their theatrical runs. It’s still too soon to estimate gross domestic sales for “Madame Web,” but, by the time it exited theaters, “Morbius” had made just $73 million.',\n",
       " 'Typically, holiday weekends are coveted real estate for movie releases, because audiences have more time to find their way to the theater. But “Madame Web,” which released February 14, struggled to gain upward momentum even along its six-day opening, which straddled two holidays: Valentine’s Day and Presidents’ Day.',\n",
       " 'Taking advantage of the same six-day stretch, “Bob Marley: One Love,” a musical biopic of the reggae icon, opened to a strong $52 million, according to Comscore estimates, cinching the top spot for the weekend.',\n",
       " '“A well-known historical figure can be as good as an established franchise brand when it comes to getting moviegoers’ attention, so there is an inherent familiarity of subject matter when it comes to biopics,” said Robbins. “The release was smartly timed around Valentine’s Day with Marley’s life-affirming philosophies driving the heart of marketing.”',\n",
       " '“One Love” follows a recent pattern of high-performing music-centric movies, added Dergarabedian. Recent months have seen musical box office hits like “Wonka,” “Mean Girls,” and successful concert films from both Beyonce and Taylor Swift.',\n",
       " '“The Marley film was perfectly timed and rode a wave of popularity all the way from its Valentines Day release through Monday, and the studio really knocked it out of the park with their marketing strategy and by delivering a film that fans of all ages gravitated toward due to the enduring appeal of Bob Marley’s music, message and legacy,” Dergarabedian said. “The film should have long-term success and keep ‘Jammin’ toward even bigger box office heights in the coming weeks.”',\n",
       " 'According to data from Comscore, the film opened with $14 million in domestic sales, the third-highest-grossing opening day for a musical biopic in the past 35 years, unadjusted for inflation. 2015’s “Straight Out of Compton” still holds the No. 1 spot with $24 million, followed by 2018’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” with $18 million.']"

But with “Avatar: The Way of Water” finally hitting theaters 13 years after the original – joining “Aliens” and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” on the honor roll of Cameron-directed encores – he might legitimately bear the title king of the sequel.',\n",
       " 'Those films each came seven years after the first movies were released, and both paved the way for multiple sequels that followed. In each case, Cameron (who wrote or shared screenplay credit on all three) cleverly expanded upon, rather than simply replicating, the existing template, perhaps most impressively with “Aliens,” which was based on a movie directed by Ridley Scott as opposed to his own.',\n",
       " 'After the haunted-house-in-outer-space concept of “Alien,” the sequel called in the Marines for a more adventurous and muscular battle, one that included introducing the complex bug-like dynamics of the alien creatures. Cameron similarly revised the formula in “Judgment Day” by turning his original villain into the hero, introducing a new and different mechanized threat for Arnold Schwarzenegger’s catchphrase-spouting cyborg to face.',\n",
       " 'The second “Terminator” also marked a massive leap forward into the world of computer-generated visual effects with its shape-shifting liquid robot, which helped lay the groundwork for “Jurassic Park” and the technological explosion that followed. “Avatar” also advanced that ball, and “The Way of Water” feels as if it has again moved the goalposts in terms of the horizons for digital filmmaking.',\n",

       " 'Yet that almost oversimplifies the way Cameron constructed each of these movies, especially when so many sequels adhere to the “You give the audience the things that they liked” part, and pretty much quit there.',\n",
       " 'In the case of “Aliens,” for example, there’s still a taste – basically a gruesome reminder – of the gut-wrenching prospect of being turned into an alien host; still, the bulk of the movie is more rip-roaring thriller than horror, with Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley becoming not only an action hero but a surrogate mother, grounding the film with a deeper emotional aspect.',\n",
       " 'Aside from the technical advances, the new “Avatar’s” major wrinkles involve giving the central couple a family and exploring those dynamics – including kids trying to measure up to older siblings and their warrior parents – while introducing an entirely new clan with its own distinctive culture and adaptations.',\n",
       " 'While celebrating movies with a “2” affixed to them, implied if not overtly, might not sound like embracing creativity, the art of the sequel is more than just an academic exercise. In an entertainment industry that, faced with a proliferation of options, clings to the comfort of familiarity and replicating what has worked before, it’s an unavoidable quadrant of filmmaking that can’t (or at least shouldn’t) be dismissed on that level.',\n",
       " 'Cameron understands those dynamics, but that hasn’t meant resting on his laurels or treating sequels like just another consumer product – the equivalent of serving Coca-Cola in a different can.',\n",

       " 'Given the chance to do so in a Fox News town hall on Tuesday, Trump again showed his habitual refusal to criticize a Russian leader who has crushed democracy and has a long record of persecuting political opponents. He offered a tempered tribute to Navalny, before returning to his own false claims of political persecution.',\n",
       " 'He said the Russian dissident, whose body still has not been returned to his family, was “a very brave guy” but that he probably should not have returned to Russia ahead of his imprisonment. Then, Trump returned to his obsession with his own treatment in his own country that unlike Russia offers constitutional guarantees of the right to a fair trial, political freedoms and is a place where voters get to choose their president.',\n",
       " '“It’s happening in our country too. We are turning into a Communist country in many ways. And if you look at it, I’m the leading candidate, I got indicted. … I got indicted four times. I have eight or nine trials … all because of the facts that I’m in politics,” Trump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, said in the Fox News event. Later, when referring to a $355 million civil fraud judgment against him last week, he added that “it is a form of Navalny, it is a form of communism or fascism.”',\n",

He was indicted by grand juries of his peers in his criminal cases in which he is entitled to a trial by jury. He also has the right of appeal — that he has taken up multiple times already. None of these protections exist in the Russian legal system. And despite Trump’s claims that he’s a victim of persecution, the ex-president is being prosecuted according to the rule of law, including for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and over his hoarding of classified documents.',\n",
       " 'In fact, Trump’s authoritarian instincts suggest that he has more in common temperamentally with Putin than Navalny. The absolute presidential immunity from prosecution that Trump is asking the Supreme Court to grant him and his vision of an unconstrained presidency seem closer to the Russian model than the American one.',\n",
       " 'Trump has variously described Putin — an accused war criminal over his invasion of Ukraine — as “a genius” and “smart” and frequently took steps while he was president that appeared to satisfy Russian goals as much as long-term US interests. He even sided with the Russian leader’s denials of election interference in 2016 instead of taking the word of the intelligence agencies that were then under his control.',\n",

       " 'The president has not hidden his disgust at House Republicans in his predecessor’s thrall who have refused to pass his latest $60 billion arms and ammunition package for Ukraine that has just been endorsed by a bipartisan majority in the Senate. Biden has harshly condemned Trump’s remark in a recent campaign rally that he would encourage Russia to invade NATO partners that did not meet their targets for defense spending. The White House said on Tuesday that it is readying a new round of sanctions on Russia following Navalny’s death that will join the punishing regime of restrictions that have already been imposed over the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.',\n",

       " 'When you look at the facts now, it seems ridiculous and incredible – a single, unverified FBI interview blows up into public allegations against the president of the United States and fuels plans for his impeachment.',\n",
       " 'But it has taken months of incremental developments to arrive at this point, and there are many unanswered questions in the developing saga of Alexander Smirnov, the accused peddler of misinformation. Smirnov has been charged with lying to the FBI and creating false records, but he has not yet entered a plea. His lawyers say he’s “presumed innocent” and will rigorously fight the charges.',\n",
       " 'Here’s what we actually do know at this point:',\n",
       " 'Smirnov is a 43-year-old dual American-Israeli citizen who moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas two years ago. A “confidential human source” for the FBI, he provided an FBI agent, his “handler,” information that had been used in multiple investigations dating back to 2010, according to a federal indictment.',\n",
       " 'Very little is known publicly about Smirnov. CNN has not obtained a photograph of him, for instance, and he shielded himself by covering his face when leaving court Tuesday, although he does appear to have quite a bit of money. Prosecutors, in asking unsuccessfully for Smirnov to be kept behind bars while he awaits trial, said he has access to more than $6 million in bank accounts and claims to have contacts with multiple foreign agencies. Plus, they said he was planning a monthslong trip out of the US when he was arrested.',\n",
       " 'A judge rejected those arguments. Smirnov was released from custody Tuesday but is required to wear a GPS monitoring device and had to surrender his two passports, among other conditions.',\n",
       " 'There were, according to the indictment, multiple stories.',\n",
       " 'First, in 2017, Smirnov told the FBI he had been in contact with executives at Burisma, the Ukrainian oil and natural gas company that paid Joe Biden’s son Hunter to be on its board, including while his father was vice president and oversaw US policy toward Ukraine.',\n",
       " 'Smirnov told his handler that Burisma was interested in buying a US-based oil company. Hunter Biden was briefly mentioned, but no allegation about either Biden was made by Smirnov. The handler documented all of this in what the FBI calls an FD-1023.',\n",
       " 'Years later, when Joe Biden was running for president, Smirnov added a bribery allegation.',\n",
       " 'In May 2020, Smirnov texted his handler multiple times about the presidential election, showing a bias against Biden, according to prosecutors. He did not make any specific allegations, but alluded to a bribe he said he would try to prove occurred.',\n",
       " 'By June 2020, there was an investigation led by the now-former, Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Pittsburgh, Scott Brady, into any allegations involving the Bidens and Ukraine, including dubious claims being pushed by then-Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. Smirnov’s handler, at Brady’s request, reached out to Smirnov to follow up on his innocuous mention of Hunter Biden years before.',\n",
       " 'According to the indictment, in a phone conversation in June 2020, after Joe Biden had secured the Democratic presidential nomination, Smirnov described for the first time meetings and phone calls he claimed occurred in 2015 and/or 2016 in which, he alleged, Burisma executives discussed paying $5 million bribes each to both Bidens for protection through Joe Biden’s position as vice president.',\n",
       " 'Smirnov said the alleged bribe was intended to help shut down a supposed Ukrainian criminal probe into Burisma, prosecutors said. As vice president, Joe Biden, along with multiple Western officials, had encouraged Ukraine to oust then-Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin. There’s no evidence Shokin was actively investigating Burisma at the time. Biden and US allies wanted Shokin fired for being too soft on corruption – his ouster in 2016 actually would’ve increased, not decreased, potential scrutiny of Burisma.',\n",
       " 'Smirnov’s new, explosive but questionable allegations resulted in a second FD-1023.',\n",
       " 'Efforts to confirm the allegations continued over the next few months, and Brady’s FBI partners in Pittsburgh concluded in August 2020 that the matter should be closed. Senior FBI and Justice Department officials in Washington, DC, concurred.',\n",
       " 'The information was ultimately passed on to the Trump-appointed US attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, who was overseeing investigations related to Hunter Biden. Brady told Congress last year that he had believed there was a “sufficient indicia of credibility” into aspects of the 1023 – enough to pass it along to Weiss and to brief Weiss about the document.',\n",
       " 'Years later, in August 2023, Weiss was elevated by Attorney General Merrick Garland to become a special counsel for his multifaceted investigation into Hunter Biden.',\n",
       " 'That happened shortly after a plea deal between Weiss and Hunter Biden fell apart, and as Republicans pushed unproven conspiracy theories related to the 2020 FD-1023. Smirnov was officially interviewed again by the FBI in September about his Biden-related bribery allegations. He repeated the general allegations from his 2020 phone conversation, but with multiple inconsistencies, according to the indictment.',\n",
       " 'During that formal interview, prosecutors now say, Smirnov also added details he said he learned from Russian intelligence officials, including that Hunter Biden stayed at a particular hotel in Ukraine and there are tapes of him there.',\n",
       " 'For starters, Smirnov alleges the bribes were discussed at meetings with Burisma officials in 2015 or 2016, but according to the indictment there is no evidence he even met with Burisma executives until 2017, after Joe Biden was no longer vice president.',\n",
       " 'Plus, people said by Smirnov to be at pertinent meetings with Burisma officials outside of Ukraine did not leave the country between 2011 and 2017, according to the indictment.',\n",
       " '“The evidence at trial will show Smirnov’s story to the FBI was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that had actually occurred but at a later date than he claimed,” according to the indictment.',\n",
       " 'Similarly, the indictment alleges that phone conversations in which Smirnov says Burisma executives discussed payments to Biden never happened. And the tidbits that Smirnov said he got from Russian intelligence officials about Hunter Biden being recorded at a Kyiv hotel? The indictment argues Hunter Biden has never traveled to Ukraine.',\n",
       " 'Republicans on Capitol Hill have made investigating both Bidens a top priority dating back to the Trump-Ukraine impeachment in 2019. Last year, they pushed for months for the document with Smirnov’s allegations to be released even though the FBI considered it to have been debunked.',\n",
       " 'House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer had threatened to hold FBI Director Christopher Wray in contempt of Congress if the document was not released to lawmakers. Ultimately, Wray allowed members of Congress to privately view the document, but not keep it.',\n",
       " 'After the document was obtained by lawmakers from someone who sought protection under a law to protect whistleblowers, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, released it to the public and argued it could be evidence of a cover-up. It’s not publicly known who gave the document to Grassley.',\n",
       " 'Comer has embraced the unverified bribery allegation since, he said, it tracked with his broader investigation into the Biden family’s overseas business dealings.',\n",
       " 'Republicans tried to place the bribery allegations within the larger universe of Hunter Biden’s business career, in which he admittedly traded on his father’s name and made millions of dollars from companies in China and elsewhere. Despite pursuing criminal charges against Hunter Biden for his gun ownership and tax evasions, prosecutors have not alleged wrongdoing with regard to Burisma.',\n",
       " 'After releasing the FD-1023, Republicans argued it could be evidence of a cover-up.',\n",
       " '“While the FBI sought to obfuscate and redact, the American people can now read this document for themselves, without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats, thanks to brave and heroic whistleblowers,” Grassley proudly proclaimed in July.',\n",
       " 'The unverified allegations became an article of faith in GOP efforts to undercut Biden’s credibility.',\n",
       " '“Every day this bribery scandal becomes more credible,” Comer said on Fox News last July, seizing on Smirnov’s allegations.',\n",
       " 'Grassley’s decision to publicly release the unverified allegations that Weiss, a Republican-appointed US attorney, now says were lies has not aged well. Grassley has made no official comment on the recent developments.',\n",
       " 'Comer recently told Spectrum News that the impeachment effort against Biden may not ultimately occur.',\n",
       " 'But Republicans argue in talking points obtained by CNN that they have evidence beyond the FD-1023 that shows Biden was involved in the business dealings of his son and other family members.',\n",
       " 'In a statement after the Smirnov indictment was unsealed, Comer said, “the impeachment inquiry is not reliant on the FBI’s FD-1023. It is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony, revealing that Joe Biden knew of and participated in his family’s business dealings.”',\n",
       " 'Even though Republicans are maintaining that the charges against Smirnov have no impact on their work, they removed a reference to the informant from a letter sent to an unrelated witness requesting an interview, copies of the letters obtained by CNN show.',\n",
       " 'Republicans are also asking the FBI why they ever relied on the now-discredited informant in the first place. Comer says the FBI told him last year that Smirnov was “credible and trusted” and had been “paid six figures” for his information.',\n",
       " 'The Oversight Committee website still, as of this writing, includes mention of the debunked form FD-1023.',\n",
       " 'The origin of the debunked bribery story is unclear. But it’s notable that Smirnov says he has ties to Russian officials and even admits they gave him information about Hunter Biden – information that the Justice Department says is false.',\n",
       " 'Given how Smirnov’s story has changed over time, according to the indictment, it’s hard to know exactly what to believe.',\n",
       " 'There is, however, a confirmed track record of Russians spreading disinformation about the Bidens in Ukraine. It’s the same storyline that then-President Trump seized on when he dispatched Giuliani to build a case against Joe Biden before the 2020 election.',\n",
       " 'The anti-Biden messages Smirnov allegedly sent to his handler in 2020 included references to a former Ukrainian lawmaker, Andriy Derkach, who worked with Giuliani in 2020. Derkach and his allies were labeled later that year by the US government as agents of the Russian government and sanctioned for trying to meddle in the 2020 election to hurt Joe Biden’s chances.',\n",
       " 'The disinformation continues.',\n",
       " '“(Smirnov) is actively peddling new lies that could impact U.S. elections after meeting with Russian intelligence officials in November,” prosecutors said in court documents.',\n",
       " 'After Hunter Biden’s plea deal collapsed last summer, Weiss was given the title of special counsel to give him independence from the Department of Justice, which is run by Biden appointees. He is the person currently prosecuting Hunter Biden in Delaware for illegally owning a gun while he was addicted to drugs and in California for tax evasion. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases.',\n",
       " 'Weiss is now also using his special counsel powers to prosecute Smirnov for lying to the FBI and making up the bribery story about the Bidens.',\n",
       " 'Ironically, Republicans cheered on his prosecution against Hunter Biden, but it’s now the Democrats who are trumpeting his case against Smirnov.',\n",

       " 'The refusal of pro-Donald Trump Republicans in Congress to extend a military lifeline for Ukraine, and the former president’s return to attacking NATO allies in ways that align with Putin’s goals, show that Trump is already reshaping geopolitical realities months before his possible White House return.',\n",
       " 'Most immediately, enormous pressure is building on inexperienced House Speaker Mike Johnson – who would likely need to spurn the powerful Trump wing of the GOP and use Democratic votes to pass billions of dollars in Ukraine aid already endorsed by the Senate. Such a move could cost Johnson his job atop the tiny, fractious GOP majority.',\n",
       " 'But more broadly, the transformation of Republican foreign policy reflected in the showdown over Ukraine is stoking alarm about Trump’s longer-term intentions in any second term beyond Ukraine. This includes the possibility he could seek to quit NATO and thereby dismantle the post-World War II transatlantic security arrangements that won the Cold War and led to 80 years of peace in Europe.',\n",
       " 'The willingness of some GOP lawmakers to walk away from Ukraine and to excuse Trump’s berating of allies reflects shifting political forces in the US, partly dictated by the former president’s “America first” nationalism. But public sentiment has also been molded by an exhausting first two decades of the 21st Century, that were scarred by bloody wars abroad and several financial and domestic crises.',\n",
       " 'President Joe Biden has reacted to Trump’s recent rhetoric with disgust, framing it as a breach of America’s historic leadership role, and he laid blame with GOP lawmakers for recent Ukrainian battlefield reversals.',\n",
       " 'The White House said on Saturday after Biden called President Volodymyr Zelensky that “Ukraine’s military was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka after Ukrainian soldiers had to ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction, resulting in Russia’s first notable gains in months.”',\n",
       " 'Biden also assured Zelensky of continuing US support ahead of the second anniversary of the invasion. But given hardening GOP sentiment against more aid, including the refusal by Johnson to bring a Senate-passed aid package up for a vote, that assurance that looks increasingly shaky.',\n",
       " 'And more broadly, if only one of America’s two governing parties fully opposes Russian expansionism and supports NATO security guarantees that have endured for decades, the US will forfeit its position as a bulwark of Western security, alarming its allies and offering multiple openings for adversaries in the Kremlin.',\n",
       " 'The transformation of the GOP – which once boasted of defeating the Soviet Union – has been highlighted by Trump’s failure to join the global outrage at the death of opposition hero Alexey Navalny. In a statement on Monday, Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, likened Putin’s brutal autocracy to America, drawing an apparent analogy between his own legal problems and the persecution dealt out to the courageous Russian dissident.',\n",
       " 'Trump has also not repudiated his recent comment that he’d invite Russia to invade NATO nations that fell short of non-binding targets on defense spending. He even trumpeted on Monday an endorsement from Hungary’s Viktor Orban, Putin’s closest ally in the European Union and an anti-democratic strongman.',\n",
       " 'Trump’s bizarre deference to Putin is not new – his genuflecting was a frequent theme of his presidency. But it is even more striking now, given the Russian leader’s status as an accused war criminal who launched an unprovoked invasion of a democratic neighbor. After propping up Ukraine for two years with billions of dollars in aid and ammunition, a US decision to walk away and leave it to Putin would represent a stunning change of course.',\n",
       " 'Aside from the mysterious hold that Putin appears to exert over Trump, the ex-president’s hostility towards Ukraine is easily explainable. Zelensky after all refused his entreaties to launch a criminal investigation against Biden before the 2020 election. The coercion campaign was at the heart of Trump’s first impeachment. ',\n",
       " 'Opposing aid to Ukraine is also an almost perfect issue for the ex-president and his allies in the GOP primary. His opposition to arms and ammunition transfers as well as his criticism of NATO allies over their defense budgets plays into his core claim – dating right back to his 2016 campaign – that other countries are taking advantage of the United States.',\n",
       " 'Johnson is resisting demands from the White House to allow a vote on a bill that passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis, arguing that America can’t fix another nation’s borders before it fixes its own. This is an argument that strongly resonates with Republican voters. Many question why billions more dollars should be sent to Ukraine while they struggle with high grocery prices and interest rates and wonder why America isn’t taking care of its own first.',\n",
       " 'Ukraine badly needs arms and ammunition amid signs that momentum is shifting to Russia on the battlefield. This is likely to train even more scrutiny on a speaker who was a largely unknown figure when he was thrust into the job as a last resort candidate following Kevin McCarthy’s ouster last year. Johnson’s reputation hasn’t been helped by the House’s departure for a two-week recess while Ukrainian front-line soldiers ration bullets.',\n",
       " 'But even if Johnson can solve the short-term conundrum over this bill and the package ends up getting passed, America’s fraught election-year dynamics and a more nationalist, isolationist, Republican Party mean that prospects for long-term US bankrolling of Ukraine’s war look grim – given the expectation that whoever wins the presidential election, the country and Congress will remain closely divided.',\n",
       " 'Several Republicans took their unwelcome message to the Munich Security Conference at the weekend.',\n",
       " 'Ohio Sen. JD Vance, a big Trump fan, argued that the current $60 billion US aid proposal for Ukraine “is not going to fundamentally change the reality on the battlefield.” He said the US doesn’t have the manufacturing capacity to pump out sufficient ammunition for Ukraine as well as its own needs. He called for a negotiated peace with Russia to end the war and complained there was no clear end game for US policy. And while he doesn’t favor pulling out of NATO, he said Europe must do more in its own defense as the US looks to China.',\n",
       " '“I do not think that Vladimir Putin is an existential threat to Europe and to the extent that he is, again, that suggests that Europe has to take a more aggressive role in its own security,” Vance said.',\n",
       " 'The Ohio senator’s arguments paralleled those of multiple US presidents who have long griped that Europe should do more.',\n",
       " 'While NATO defense spending has been rising, only 18 of 31 alliance members are expected to reach a target of 2% of their GDP this year. Even those that do face questions about readiness and capacity. And Vance’s implication that the West will never be able muster the indefinite cash needed to prop up Ukraine is not outlandish. In 2016, two years after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, then-President Barack Obama told “The Atlantic” that Ukraine is “going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia no matter what we do.”',\n",
       " 'Still, Vance’s contention that Putin would pose no existential threat to Europe is debatable, especially if the Russian leader’s aggression is rewarded in Ukraine. And there may be no end game in the war as Putin seems determined to stay engaged as long as it takes, and Ukraine is unlikely to accept any Russian guarantees under a negotiated peace deal.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, when it comes to China, the Republican position that the US needs to make a deal with Russia so it can concentrate on East Asia seems naïve. Increasingly, links between Beijing, Moscow, Iran and North Korea mean the new geopolitical game is global. And there’s no reason to think Putin has any interest in forging stability in Europe so the US can turn to another foe.',\n",
       " 'But Vance is part of a new generation of Republicans who represent a more nationalist and transactional brand of foreign policy – that is unlikely to change even when Trump is no longer their party’s dominant figure. For instance, former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has been calling for a return to the hawkish foreign policy that dominated the GOP for decades. On Monday for instance, she accused Trump of going “weak in the knees” over Russia. But Haley trails Trump badly in the GOP primary race, and she often seems to be running for the leadership of a party that no longer exists.',\n",
       " 'Evolving foreign policy sentiments among GOP voters was highlighted in a new report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs that found that a majority of Republicans think it would be best for the future of the US to stay out of – rather than take an active part in – world affairs. Pro-Trump Republicans were even more negative about the US having a global role.',\n",
       " 'These pressures weigh on Republican lawmakers as they cast increasingly tough votes on Ukraine aid.',\n",
       " 'The dilemma is encapsulated by Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Republican who supports more aid for Ukraine but voted against the package last week on the grounds that the US needed to do more to halt the flow of undocumented migrants coming across the border. Ricketts was also in Munich at the weekend, and tried to assure skeptical Europeans that, eventually, Congress would act on aid for Ukraine. He also summed up what could be at risk if Trump decides to neuter the Western alliance.',\n",
       " '“I was talking to a mother at my state fair, (and) she said, ‘Senator, I don’t want my 18-year-old fighting in Europe,’” Ricketts recounted. “I said, ‘That’s why we’re giving Ukraine weapons. So that that doesn’t happen because if Ukraine loses, and Putin invades one of our NATO allies, then your 18-year-old will be fighting in Europe.’”',\n",

       " 'There’s a glaring need for leaders in the US and Europe who are younger than Biden and 82-year-old Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who helped steer Ukraine aid through the chamber, to make the case for NATO’s role in keeping the peace.',\n",

       " 'Yet it wasn’t always this way. Early in his tenure, Putin sought cooperation. He was one of the first world leaders to call President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Bush famously once looked into Putin’s eyes and said he got “a sense of his soul” — one of the many catastrophic misjudgments of the Russian leader by presidents in the 21st century. President Barack Obama attempted a “reset” of relations with Moscow. But after a period as prime minister, Putin returned to the presidency and became increasingly hostile toward the West. The Russian leader was particularly incensed by the US-led operation to topple Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Obama’s critics now say he did too little to respond to Putin’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and paved the way for Russia’s full invasion two years ago.',\n",
       " 'Trump came to office haunted by allegations that his team colluded with Russia’s effort to damage 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. A probe by special counsel Robert Mueller did not find evidence of conspiring between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the special counsel did detail multiple contacts between the two and wrote that the Trump campaign believed it would benefit from information stolen and released by the Russians. Whether Russia helped Trump win is impossible to say. But the subsequent fallout forever soured the new president on US intelligence agencies that he regarded as a hostile “Deep State” and led him to torch their credibility among his millions of supporters. This whipping up of domestic antagonism and the damage to US institutions plays into Russia’s goals. And the spectacle of Trump, as president at a Helsinki summit, siding with Putin and trashing US intelligence agencies over their claims of election interference remains one of the most staggering moments in the history of US-Russia relations.',\n",
       " 'When Biden took over, he made a high-stakes bid to reduce the poison from relations with Moscow, meeting Putin in Geneva in an echo of old Cold War summitry. Approaching the talks with deep skepticism, Biden sought to halt Russian cybersecurity attacks and to reopen nuclear disarmament negotiations while trying to ease the risks of an accidental war.',\n",

       " 'But the record shows that they had repeatedly put Smirnov’s unverified bribery allegation front and center as they made their case against Biden. In 2023 and into 2024, members of the House leadership and rank-and-file House members depicted the bribery allegation as critical to the impeachment push – and sometimes as hard proof that the president is corrupt.',\n",
       " 'In May 2023, Rep. James Comer, a key impeachment figure as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said the FBI form that memorialized the informant’s uncorroborated and now-discredited allegation was both “very crucial” and “very credible.” Just last month, Rep. Jim Jordan, another key impeachment figure as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, described the FBI form as “the most corroborating evidence we have.”',\n",
       " 'Multiple rank-and-file members of the House Republican caucus, meanwhile, joined former President Donald Trump and other Republicans in explicitly asserting that Biden took a bribe – going much further than the FBI form, which merely noted what the informant claimed to have been told by the Ukrainian energy executive, Mykola Zlochevsky of Burisma Holdings.',\n",
       " 'Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado told CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday: “We were warned at the time that we received the document … we were warned that the credibility of this statement was not known. And yet people, my colleagues, went out and talked to the public about how this was credible and how it was damning and how it proved President Biden’s – at the time Vice President Biden’s – complicity in receiving bribes. It appears to absolutely be false and to really undercut the nature of the charges.”',\n",
       " 'Comer and other Republicans are correct to note that their impeachment probe has always involved various other claims about Biden and his family’s foreign business dealings, though they have not presented any proof of wrongdoing by the president. But there’s no doubt that Republicans made the bribery claim central to their rhetoric before it was shattered last week.',\n",
       " 'Here’s a partial list of how House Republicans depicted the phony allegation. Many of their comments have been previously discussed this month by CNN and by other media outlets, including The Washington Post and NBC News.

And then you have all this other evidence that Jamie (Comer) and Jason (Smith) have brought forward from their committees that support that. But the most corroborating evidence we have is that 1023 form from this highly credible confidential human source, according to US Attorney Scott Brady.”',\n",
       " 'Brady testified to Congress in 2023 that the FBI form had included enough “indicia of credibility” to merit more investigation, so his team had handed it over to the US attorney in Delaware, David Weiss, who was investigating Hunter Biden (and is now the special counsel who has brought charges against both Hunter Biden and Smirnov). But the FBI office in Brady’s jurisdiction later concluded that the matter should be closed, and FBI and Justice Department officials in Washington, DC, agreed.',\n",
       " 'Comer called the FBI form ‘very crucial’ to the probe and spoke of a ‘bribery scandal’',\n",
       " 'In a May 2023 appearance on Fox News, Comer criticized the FBI for not turning over the form and said “this is a very crucial piece of our investigation,” adding that “I think it’s very credible.” Then, in another Fox News appearance in July, after Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley obtained the form from “Justice Department whistleblowers” and released it, Comer said, “Every day this bribery scandal becomes more credible” – even though the witness whose testimony he was discussing had actually testified that he had no knowledge of the supposed bribe.',\n",
       " 'The oversight committee’s investigation page listed the informant’s claim as ‘key evidence’',\n",
       " 'The FBI form was listed as “key evidence” on Comer’s committee’s web page about its investigation into the Biden family. The web page said the FBI form alleged that Biden had “engaged in a bribery and extortion scheme” in which he received $5 million.',\n",
       " 'The item was removed from the web page’s “key evidence” list this month after Smirnov was indicted. House Republicans also removed a reference to Smirnov from a letter sent to an unrelated witness requesting an interview.',\n",

       " 'Stefanik didn’t explain what she meant by “potential tapes,” but the FBI form noted Smirnov’s claim that Zlochevsky had numerous audio recordings demonstrating that he was “coerced” by Joe Biden and Hunter Biden into paying them off. The indictment of Smirnov says those claims were false and that he knew they were false.',\n",
       " 'Later, in a September 2023 speech, Stefanik cited the bribery allegation, among other claims about Biden, in support of the opening of the impeachment inquiry.',\n",

       " 'In September 2023, Johnson, now the House Speaker and then a member of the House Republican leadership as conference vice chairman, gave a speech claiming they had uncovered “so many scandals” and “so much corruption” that Americans are getting lost in the evidence and allegations, so he would offer some “highlights” to “help explain why we’re doing what we’re doing.” One of these supposed highlights was the allegation about the bribe, which Johnson said was from a source “known well to the FBI and relied upon often.”',\n",

       " 'At a September 2023 congressional hearing titled “The Basis for an Impeachment Inquiry of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,” Mace described the then-unverified and now-debunked bribery allegation as a confirmed fact. She said, “We already know the president took bribes from Burisma. I also want to add: betraying your country is treason.”',\n",
       " 'Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas described the bribery allegation as ‘gold’ and ‘direct evidence of naked corruption’',\n",
       " 'At the same hearing where Mace spoke, Fallon acknowledged that an FBI form like this could be either “garbage” or “gold” depending on the reliability of the source, but since this informant was a longtime FBI source who had been viewed as reliable, “This, ladies and gentlemen, is gold.” After recounting the bribery allegation included on the form, Fallon said, “This is direct evidence of naked corruption and bribery.”',\n",

       " 'When Burchett was asked on Fox News in July 2023 whether he expected Biden to be impeached, he said yes – and immediately cited the bribery allegation: “The evidence is overwhelming … the nail is in the coffin. This coffin is just completely made of nails. We’re not talking about Republican partisan witnesses from some far-right wing conspiracy. We’re talking about FBI informants, trusted FBI informants, coming forth.”',\n",
       " 'Later in the interview, Burchett said, “How much more evidence can you have?” He continued, “They keep saying ‘show me the evidence,’ and we’ve shown them the evidence. I don’t know what else you need other than President Biden coming on the news saying, ‘Hey, I’m a crook. I took this money. I took these bribes.’ I mean, what else do they need? There’s just too much evidence in it. And it’s all documented.”',\n",

       " 'Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida described the FBI form as ‘proof’ of Biden corruption and also linked it to impeachment',\n",
       " 'After viewing the FBI document, Luna said in a Fox News interview in June 2023 that while the oversight committee had been speculating on the bribery matter, now “we have proof.” Luna said she is certain Biden is “corrupt” and added, “Unless we run an impeachment, I don’t think that the FBI or the DOJ is going to do their job and hold him to the same standard of justice” that she or Mace would face under the same circumstances.',\n",
       " 'Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia cited the bribery allegation as proof of corruption and the need for an impeachment inquiry',\n",
       " 'When Clyde was asked on Fox News in August 2023 whether he would vote in favor of an impeachment inquiry, he responded, “Well, I’m certainly in favor of an impeachment inquiry. We have never seen corruption like this at the executive level in my lifetime. I mean, this is the most corrupt president. You just have to read the FBI’s FD-1023 form of the interview with the president of Burisma” – though the form actually recorded what Smirnov claimed to have been told by the head of Burisma – “to see that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden were bribing or requiring from, really extorting, Burisma, to the tune of $10 million – $5 million for each one of them. I mean, come on. This is using taxpayer dollars to leverage money into his own pocket.”',\n",

       " 'Koenig was constantly in awe of the natural beauty that often surrounds golf courses, recounting tales of an encounter with a “big old alligator” in South Carolina, deer that were close enough to pet at Pebble Beach, venomous copperhead snakes and bighorn sheep.',\n",
       " '“I’d love to say I wrestled a bear on the 18th green,” he laughed. “That didn’t happen, but I definitely had some close encounters [with nature.]”',\n",
       " 'The only thing that kept Koenig off a golf course was lightning. Otherwise, he played on through whatever the weather conditions.',\n",
       " '“At Royal New Kent in Virginia, the rain was sideways, and I was completely soaked.\\nIf I’d jumped into a pool afterwards, I wouldn’t have been any more wet.”',\n",
       " 'However, there was the occasional bureaucratic hurdle to jump. Koenig recounts a heated conversation with the golf course superintendent at one Virginia course who was reluctant to let him play the back nine.',\n",
       " '“To his credit, I shouldn’t have been out there in the first place, the course was unplayable. But I explained to him what I was doing, and he agreed to let me finish. So, a shoutout to Royal New Kent – without them it’s 579 instead of 580!”',\n",
       " 'His record could have been even higher, but for the fact that he loved the game too much.',\n",
       " '“I was particularly excited about Sand Hills in Nebraska,” Koenig explained. “I planned my schedule around that. It was a spectacular day and so we played it twice, even though it only counted once.”',\n",
       " 'Koenig’s best round was a 67. His worst, a 91.',\n",
       " '“I lost a mental grasp on that round,” he explained, “I had 13 penalty strokes.\\nEvery tee ball went sailing into the woods.”',\n",
       " 'Over the course of his adventures, he estimates that his combined scored was around 3,000 over par. He says that he walked around 70% of the time, covering roughly 2,000 miles on foot, and remarkably he never fell ill or got hurt – although one minor injury was self-inflicted.',\n",
       " '“There was one moment where I lost my cool, there was a scheduling snafu and I got a little hot – I punched the side of a golf cart,” Koenig recalled.',\n",
       " '“It was a stupid thing to do. I hurt my finger, and I couldn’t really grip the club for the next round. Every year I’ve had one sort of flu or something like that, but this year I was 100% for 365 days. I’ll thank the golf gods for bestowing me that gift.”',\n",
       " 'Just as important as his health and wellbeing was the fact that he never tired of his mission. No matter what the game threw at him, he always returned for more.',\n",
       " '“I was very driven,” he said. “There was never a day when I didn’t want to play golf. Some days I wanted to sleep because I was tired, but I was like, ‘Oh, I can get up and play golf. That’s my job this year!’',\n",
       " '“I think a lot of people might have got tired, but I’m not one of those people.”',\n",
       " 'The enthusiasm with which Koenig recounts his adventure is infectious, and he acknowledges his passionate supporters who enabled him to keep going.',\n",
       " 'His partner, Rachel Alcone, gave the project her blessing and visited him regularly, bearing cakes denoting the number of courses that he’d played.',\n",
       " '“[She] was there when I came up with the idea and was very supportive, almost unbelievably so. I consider myself a very lucky man – she’s the number one golf girlfriend in the entire land!”',\n",
       " 'By the time Koenig sunk his last putt on January 2 this year at Chambers Bay in the state of Washington, he had averaged close to 1.6 rounds a day.',\n",
       " 'On Instagram, he described it as “one of the most rewarding and challenging years of his life.” As he reflects and adjusts to living in a house without wheels, he ponders what it would take for somebody to beat his record one day.',\n",
       " '“It’s going to take a lot of money,” he says, “And it’s going to take a year.” He speculates that it would be an easier task for somebody to limit their travel to an area like Florida and hammer out 36 holes a day, “but that wouldn’t be as fun.”',\n",
       " 'He wonders if there would be any point to doing it that way, because the real joy for him wasn’t so much the destination as the journey.',\n",
       " '“No offense,” he chuckled, acknowledging that he was being interviewed by a news organization, “but when you turn on the news, you can get a negative view of the world that we live in. My existence for the last year was not in front of a screen – I spent a year bathing in the goodness of humanity.”',\n",
       " 'Everywhere he went, from California to Florida and from Vermont to Texas, Koenig encountered people from all walks of life and every political stripe. They were all excited to meet him and he walked the fairways with many of them.',\n",
       " '“You see America, the people that live there and all these things that make America so cool,” said Koenig, who aw a country divided, but only on the surface. “Our differences are not that much.”',\n",
       " '“Golf strips away a lot of that stuff and it teaches you that we’re all human beings. We’re all after the same things, love and happiness and caring for our families,” added Koenig.',\n",
       " '“When you’re hitting a ball around in a field, you realize that you can make friends with people that you would never encounter in a million years. You learn something from those people.',\n",

       " 'One of the world’s top high jumpers, Mahuchikh knew that absolute concentration was required to perfectly execute her run-up, take-off and back-arching leap, but still her mind would gravitate towards the distressing situation thousands of miles away back home.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps that’s only natural when your country is at war and fresh missile attacks are being launched on a regular basis – some even directed at blocks in your hometown.',\n",
       " '“It’s challenging for me to compete after reading the news of rockets sent to civilians,” Mahuchikh tells CNN Sport. “I’m thinking about how many people died, how many peoples’ houses were destroyed. It’s difficult.”',\n",
       " 'That strategy – of trying to shut out Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before she competes – proved effective last year. Mahuchikh won her first world championship title in August, then successfully defended her Diamond League Final victory in September.',\n",
       " 'Understandably, her confidence is now high for the months ahead. That includes the Millrose Games in New York this weekend, the world indoor championships in Glasgow in March and then the Paris Olympics in July and August.',\n",
       " 'She’s unsure if she will return to Ukraine in that time having moved between various training bases around Europe for most of the past two years. Because of the war, itinerancy has become a common theme in her life.',\n",
       " '“I live in a suitcase, really,” says Mahuchikh, “because with traveling, we don’t have a hometown.”',\n",
       " 'Her family – her mother and sister – have sometimes joined the 22-year-old while she is on the road, but her father, like many Ukrainians, has stayed at home in Dnipro. That’s often a source of anxiety for Mahuchikh, especially when Russian attacks target the eastern city.',\n",
       " '“My father, he said that, unfortunately, for a lot of people, it’s life right now, we live in this way,” she explains.',\n",
       " '“And they continue their life. My father sometimes says, ‘Oh, you know, if the rockets come, it’s okay, it’s my life, maybe it’s God saying that it’s finished.’ And I say, ‘Oh my gosh, father, please – go to the basement.’”',\n",
       " 'Dnipro has absorbed several deadly missile attacks throughout the invasion, with the Russian military targeting apartment blocks and medical facilities in the city.',\n",
       " 'In August last year, Ukraine’s War Crimes Department in the Prosecutor General’s Office said that approximately 10,749 civilians had been killed during the war and 15,599 wounded.',\n",

       " '“If I was not an athlete at international level, I think I would be in Ukraine,” she says. “But I have some goals and I’m competing for my country. I represent Ukraine at competitions; it’s my goal and it’s my mission, I think.”',\n",
       " 'Russia’s invasion has invigorated Mahuchikh’s sense of national pride. She wore blue and yellow eye shadow – the colors of the Ukrainian flag – at last year’s world championships and is supporting fundraising efforts to send wheelchairs to disabled orphans in Ukraine.',\n",

       " 'According to Vadim Guttsait, Ukraine’s sports minister and president of its National Olympic Committee (NOC), more than 400 Ukrainian athletes have been killed since the start of the war.',\n",
       " 'This year’s Olympics, Mahuchikh believes, will enable Ukrainian athletes to promote a message of peace, though perhaps inevitably, the Games have also become entwined in geopolitics.',\n",
       " 'In particular, the question of whether athletes from Russia and Belarus, a key military launchpad during the war in Ukraine, will be able to compete has become a flashpoint.',\n",
       " 'In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that athletes from those two countries will be able to take part as neutrals in Paris, so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria.',\n",
       " 'For example, only individual athletes, rather than teams, will be included in the Games, and athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to their country’s military services will be ineligible.',\n",
       " 'However, international federations have the first say on whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for the Olympics. World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, has excluded Russian and Belarusians from events “for the foreseeable future,” meaning they will be unable to compete in track and field events in Paris as things stand.',\n",
       " 'It’s a contentious topic: some, like the IOC’s executive board, believe that individual athletes shouldn’t be stopped from competing on the basis of their passport, while others, namely a campaign group representing Ukrainian athletes, argue that Russian participation of any kind only strengthens the country’s “propaganda machine.”',\n",
       " 'Mahuchikh welcomes World Athletics’ stance, believing that neutral flags are an ineffective way of concealing an athlete’s national identity.',\n",
       " '“When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed, every life that was destroyed by Russian people, by the Russian Federation,” she says, adding that she would find it “difficult” to compete against athletes from Russia and Belarus.',\n",
       " 'Last month, more than 200 sportspeople from Ukraine wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging Russians and Belarusians to be banned from competing at the Games.',\n",
       " 'However, neither local organizers nor the French government have jurisdiction over who qualifies for the Olympics, and Paris 2024 organizers have underlined that this responsibility lies with the IOC and international federations.',\n",
       " 'Guttsait has previously suggested that Ukraine could boycott the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, though a final decision is yet to be made.',\n",
       " 'Mahuchikh is against such a move, instead believing that the Olympics should represent “peace in all the world.” A bronze medalist in Tokyo three years ago, she is also one of Ukraine’s biggest stars in Paris, aiming to win what would be her country’s first gold medal in the high jump.',\n",
       " '“Every athlete wants to compete, every athlete wants to win the gold medal,” says Mahuchikh. “Of course, I have goals for winning, and I want to have this medal in my sports career.”',\n",
       " 'She has tweaked her technique ahead of the upcoming indoor season, shortening her run-up to compensate for her increased speed as she approaches the bar. Having made her season debut in Cottbus, Germany, last weekend – finishing first after clearing a world-leading height of two meters and four centimeters (about 6.69 feet) – the new technique will be put to the test again at the Millrose Games.',\n",
       " 'This is where Mahuchikh’s immediate focus lies, but in the long term, she has loftier ambitions for her career – namely Stefka Kostadinova’s world record of two meters and nine centimeters (about 6.86 feet).',\n",
       " 'The Bulgarian’s mark has stood since 1987, making it one of the longest-standing world records in track and field. Mahuchikh has watched the likes of Karsten Warholm and Mondo Duplantis – both, like her, sponsored by Puma – set records in the 400-meter hurdles and the pole vault respectively, and now she hopes to join the club.',\n",
       " '“I believe that one day I will jump 2.10,” she says. “I want to be part of this family of world record holders.”']"

The East’s point total was the highest ever, eclipsing the 196 set by the Western All-Stars in 2016, while the combined total of 397 surpassed the previous record of 374 set in 2017. The Eastern All-Stars also made a whopping 42 three-pointers to beat the record of 35 set in 2019.',\n",

       " 'With the East’s lead ballooning in the second and third quarters and little to no defense being played on either end, the game was put beyond the West’s reach relatively early on, resulting in a lack of tension down the stretch.',\n",
